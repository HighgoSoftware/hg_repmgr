 <title>Following a new primary</title>
 <para>
   Following the failure or removal of the replication cluster's existing primary
   server, <xref linkend="repmgr-standby-follow"> can be used to make 'orphaned' standbys
   follow the new primary and catch up to its current state.
 </para>
 <para>
  To demonstrate this, assuming a replication cluster in the same state as the
  end of the preceding section (<xref linkend="promoting-standby">),
  execute this:
  <programlisting>
    $ repmgr -f /etc/repmgr.conf standby follow
    INFO: changing node 3's primary to node 2
    NOTICE: restarting server using "pg_ctl -l /var/log/postgresql/startup.log -w -D '/var/lib/postgresql/data' restart"
    waiting for server to shut down......... done
    server stopped
    waiting for server to start.... done
    server started
    NOTICE: STANDBY FOLLOW successful
    DETAIL: node 3 is now attached to node 2
  </programlisting>
 </para>
 <para>
   The standby is now replicating from the new primary and
   <command><link linkend="repmgr-cluster-show">repmgr cluster show</link></command>
   output reflects this:
   <programlisting>
    $ repmgr -f /etc/repmgr.conf cluster show
     ID | Name  | Role    | Status    | Upstream | Location | Connection string
    ----+-------+---------+-----------+----------+----------+--------------------------------------
     1  | node1 | primary | - failed  |          | default  | host=node1 dbname=repmgr user=repmgr
     2  | node2 | primary | * running |          | default  | host=node2 dbname=repmgr user=repmgr
     3  | node3 | standby |   running | node2    | default  | host=node3 dbname=repmgr user=repmgr</programlisting>
 </para>
 <para>
  Note that with cascading replication, <command>repmgr standby follow</command> can also be
  used to detach a standby from its current upstream server and follow the
  primary. However it's currently not possible to have it follow another standby;
  we hope to improve this in a future release.
